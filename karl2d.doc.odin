// SETUP, WINDOW MANAGEMENT AND FRAME MANAGEMENT //
//-----------------------------------------------//

// Opens a window and initializes some internal state. The internal state will use `allocator` for
// all dynamically allocated memory.
//
// `screen_width` and `screen_height` refer to the resolution of the drawable area of the window.
// The window might be slightly larger due to borders and headers. The true width and height will be
// scaled up by the scaling setting in the operating system.
//
// Call `init` before using Karl2D procedures that depend on runtime state, such as window,
// drawing, input, audio, texture, font and shader procedures. Pure helper procedures, types and
// constants can be used before `init`.
//
// The return value is a pointer to Karl2D's internal state. You can restore this state later using
// `set_internal_state()`. This is useful for example when doing game code reload, as the state may
// get reset when the library is reloaded. You can safely ignore the return value if you have no
// such needs.
init :: proc(
	screen_width: int,
	screen_height: int,
	window_title: string,
	options := Init_Options {},
	allocator := context.allocator,
	loc := #caller_location
) -> ^State

// Updates the internal state of the library. Call this early in the frame to make sure inputs and
// frame times are up-to-date.
//
// Returns a bool that says if the player has attempted to close the window. It's up to the
// application to decide if it wants to shut down or if it (for example) wants to show a 
// confirmation dialogue.
//
// Commonly used for creating the "main loop" of a game: `for k2.update() {}`
//
// To get more control over how the frame is set up, you can skip calling this proc and instead use
// the procs it calls directly:
//
//// for {
////     k2.reset_frame_allocator()
////     k2.calculate_frame_time()
////     k2.process_events()
////     k2.update_audio_mixer()
////     
////     k2.clear(k2.BLUE)
////     k2.present()
////     
////     if k2.close_window_requested() {
////         break
////     }
//// }
update :: proc() -> bool

// Returns true the user has pressed the close button on the window, or used a key stroke such as
// ALT+F4 on Windows. The application can decide if it wants to shut down or if it wants to show
// some kind of confirmation dialogue.
//
// Called by `update`, but can be called manually if you need more control.
close_window_requested :: proc() -> bool

// Closes the window and cleans up Karl2D's internal state.
shutdown :: proc()

// Clear the "screen" with the supplied color. By default this will clear your window. But if you
// have set a Render Texture using the `set_render_texture` procedure, then that Render Texture will
// be cleared instead.
clear :: proc(color: Color)

// The library may do some internal allocations that have the lifetime of a single frame. This
// procedure empties that Frame Allocator.
//
// Called as part of `update`, but can be called manually if you need more control.
reset_frame_allocator :: proc()

// Calculates how long the previous frame took and how it has been since the application started.
// You can fetch the calculated values using `get_frame_time` and `get_time`.
//
// Called as part of `update`, but can be called manually if you need more control.
calculate_frame_time :: proc()

// Present the drawn stuff to the player. Also known as "flipping the backbuffer": Call at end of
// frame to make everything you've drawn appear on the screen.
//
// When you draw using for example `draw_texture`, then that stuff is drawn to an invisible texture
// called a "backbuffer". This makes sure that we don't see half-drawn frames. So when you are happy
// with a frame and want to show it to the player, call this procedure.
//
// WebGL note: WebGL does the backbuffer flipping automatically. But you should still call this to
// make sure that all rendering has been sent off to the GPU (as it calls `draw_current_batch()`).
present :: proc()

// Process all events that have arrived from the platform APIs. This includes keyboard, mouse,
// gamepad and window events. This procedure processes and stores the information that procs like
// `key_went_down` need.
//
// Called by `update`, but can be called manually if you need more control.
process_events :: proc()

// Fetch a list of all events that happened this frame. Most games can use the `key_is_held`, 
// `mouse_button_went_down` etc procedures to check input state. But if you want a list of events
// instead, then you can use this. These events will also include things like "Window Focus" events
// and "Window Resize" events.
//
// Note: Gamepad axis movement (analogue sticks and analogue triggers) are _not_ events. Those can
// only be queried using `k2.get_gamepad_axis`.
//
// Warning: The returned slice is only valid during the current frame! You can make a clone of it
// using the `slice.clone` procedure (import `core:slice`).
get_events :: proc() -> []Event

// Returns how many seconds the previous frame took. Often a tiny number such as 0.016 s.
//
// This value is updated when `calculate_frame_time()` runs (which is also called by `update()`).
get_frame_time :: proc() -> f32

// Returns how many seconds has elapsed since the game started. This is a `f64` number, giving good
// precision when the application runs for a long time.
//
// This value is updated when `calculate_frame_time()` runs (which is also called by `update()`).
get_time :: proc() -> f64

// Resize the drawing area of the window (the screen) to a new size. While the user cannot resize
// windows with `window_mode == .Windowed_Resizable`, this procedure is able to resize such windows.
set_screen_size :: proc(width: int, height: int)

// Gets the width of the drawing area within the window.
get_screen_width :: proc() -> int

// Gets the height of the drawing area within the window.
get_screen_height :: proc() -> int

// Gets the screen width and height as a 2D vector.
get_screen_size :: proc() -> Vec2

// Change the window title.
set_window_title :: proc(title: string)

// Moves the window.
//
// This does nothing for web builds.
set_window_position :: proc(x: int, y: int)

// Gets the window position in the same coordinate system used by `set_window_position`.
//
// This returns {} for web and Wayland builds.
get_window_position :: proc() -> Vec2

// Fetch the scale of the window. This usually comes from some DPI scaling setting in the OS.
// 1 means 100% scale, 1.5 means 150% etc.
//
// Karl2D does not do any automatic scaling. If you want a scaled resolution, then multiply the
// wanted resolution by the scale and send it into `set_screen_size`. You can use a camera and set
// the zoom to the window scale in order to make things the same percieved size.
get_window_scale :: proc() -> f32

// Use to change between windowed mode, resizable windowed mode and fullscreen
set_window_mode :: proc(window_mode: Window_Mode)

// Flushes the current batch. A batch consists of a number of draw calls and a vertex buffer. This
// procedure sends all that off to the rendering backend for drawing. Normally, you do not need to
// call this procedure manually. It is done automatically when `present` or `clear` run. It can also
// happen when you destroy a resource such as a texture or shader that is used in the current
// batch.
//
// Note that `set_z` never starts a new draw call: the z value is stored in each vertex rather than
// being part of a draw call's settings, so it's fine to call it before every draw.
//
// All the draw calls of a batch share a vertex buffer of VERTEX_BUFFER_MAX bytes. The shader
// dictates how big a vertex is. The maximum number of vertices in a batch is therefore
// `VERTEX_BUFFER_MAX / shader.vertex_size`. Running out of room flushes the batch automatically.
draw_current_batch :: proc()

//-------//
// INPUT //
//-------//

// Returns true if a keyboard key went down between the current and the previous frame. Set when
// 'process_events' runs.
//
// If `allow_repeat` is true, then this also returns true for OS-generated key-repeat events (the
// same behavior a text editor wants when you hold down Backspace). The repeat rate and initial
// delay come from the operating system's keyboard settings.
key_went_down :: proc(key: Keyboard_Key, allow_repeat := false) -> bool

// Returns true if a keyboard key went up (was released) between the current and the previous frame.
// Set when 'process_events' runs.
key_went_up :: proc(key: Keyboard_Key) -> bool

// Returns true if a keyboard is currently being held down. Set when 'process_events' runs.
key_is_held :: proc(key: Keyboard_Key) -> bool

// Returns all the Unicode code points that were typed since the last frame, taking the current
// keyboard layout into account. This is what you want for text input, as opposed to
// `key_went_down`, which tells you about physical keys rather than the characters they produce.
//
// Control characters (Backspace, Enter, Tab, etc) and presses of modifier keys on their own are
// never included.
//
// Warning: The returned slice is only valid during the current frame! You can make a clone of it
// using the `slice.clone` procedure (import `core:slice`).
get_typed_runes :: proc() -> []rune

// Returns which modifiers are held. The possible values are `Control`, `Alt`, `Shift` and `Super`.
// You can check that an exact set of modifiers are held like so:
//
// `if k2.get_held_modifiers() == { .Control, Shift} {}`
//
// This will only be true if left/right control are held and left/right shift are held, but it also
// makes sure that no alt or super (windows) key are held.
//
// This is useful for checking for held modifiers for hotkeys in user interfaces. If you want to
// associate an in-game action with a specific key such as Left Control, then it's better to just do
// `if k2.key_is_held(.Left_Control) {}`
get_held_modifiers :: proc() -> bit_set[Modifier]

// Returns true if a mouse button went down between the current and the previous frame. Specify
// which mouse button using the `button` parameter.

mouse_button_went_down :: proc(button: Mouse_Button) -> bool

// Returns true if a mouse button went up (was released) between the current and the previous frame.
// Specify which mouse button using the `button` parameter.

mouse_button_is_held :: proc(button: Mouse_Button) -> bool

// Returns how many clicks the mouse wheel has scrolled between the previous and current frame.
// Positive means scrolling up.
get_mouse_wheel_delta :: proc() -> f32

// Returns how many clicks the horizontal mouse wheel has scrolled between the previous and current
// frame. Positive means scrolling right.
//
// A tilt wheel or a two-finger sideways swipe on a trackpad drives this one.
get_mouse_wheel_delta_horizontal :: proc() -> f32

// Returns the mouse position, measured from the top-left corner of the window.
get_mouse_position :: proc() -> Vec2

// Returns how many pixels the mouse moved between the previous and the current frame.
get_mouse_delta :: proc() -> Vec2

// Locks the mouse within the window. While the mouse is locked, you should no longer use
// get_mouse_position, as it may have weird/static values. Instead, use get_mouse_delta to fetch how
// much the mouse have been moved.
//
// On some platforms the mouse is just stuck at a specific point. On other platforms it may be
// teleported back to the center of the window on each frame.
//
// This call does not hide the cursor, do that separately using `set_cursor_hidden`.
//
// If the window loses focus, then the mouse may get unlocked. You can query the current lock
// status using `is_mouse_locked`, which should take into account if the OS has unlocked it for you
set_mouse_locked :: proc(locked: bool)

// Returns true if the mouse is currently locked. Note that the mouse can get unlocked by the OS,
// even though you previously called `set_mouse_locked(true)`. Therefore, it's best to check the
// current status using this procedure and then lock the mouse if needed.
is_mouse_locked :: proc() -> bool

// Returns true if a gamepad button is currently held down.
//
// The "trigger buttons" on some gamepads also have an analogue "axis value" associated with them.
// Fetch that value using `get_gamepad_axis()`.
gamepad_button_is_held :: proc(gamepad: Gamepad_Index, button: Gamepad_Button) -> bool

// Returns the value of analogue gamepad axes such as the thumbsticks and trigger buttons. The value
// is in the range -1 to 1 for sticks and 0 to 1 for trigger buttons.
get_gamepad_axis :: proc(gamepad: Gamepad_Index, axis: Gamepad_Axis) -> f32

// Set the left and right vibration motor speed. The range of left and right is 0 to 1. Note that on
